# Discussion

* Simulations are useful
* Not all simulations are the same
  * No clear best match for real data
* May need to use multiple simulations
* Splatter provides consistent framework
  * Makes it easy to reuse and compare simulations
* Splat simulation
  * Features
  * Independent of method
  * Simulate groups/paths
