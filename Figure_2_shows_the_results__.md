Figure \ref{fig:sc3-example} shows the results. SC3 appears to identify clusters well in the majority of simulations, in some cases producing perfect clustering. However this is not always the case and there are some simulations where the performance is much worse. It may be interesting to examine these cases further in an attempt to understand why the method performs poorly in these cases. We can also look at the genes identified by SC3. In our simulations SC3 identified many more differentially expressed genes than were truly present resulting in an overall low precision. Despite the high number of false positives we also saw a relatively low recall as some of the truly DE genes were not identified. In contrast when we look at the marker genes SC3 typically found far fewer than were simulated, however those that were identified were almost always correct, giving a high precision and low recall.
