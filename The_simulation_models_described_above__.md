The simulation models described above are sufficient for simulating a single, homogeneous population but not to reproduce the more complex situations seen in a real biological sample. One of the scenarios we could be conceivably be interested in is a sample from a complex tissue containing multiple mature cell types. We can model this situation as two or more groups of cells where several genes are differentially expressed between the different groups. The previously published simulations can reproduce this situation to some degree but are often limited to fixed fold changes between only two groups. In the Splat simulation differential expression is modelled using a process similar to that for creating expression outliers: genes are randomly selected with a given probability, a second probability is used to determine if they are up or down-regulated and then a multiplicative factor is chosen from a log-normal distribution. The user is able to define each of these parameters, as well as the number of cells, for each group, allowing flexibility in how different groups are defined. The resulting SCESet object contains information about which group each cell comes from as well as the factors applied to each gene in each group.
