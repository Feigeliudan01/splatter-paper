The simulation models described above are sufficient for simulating a single, homogeneous population but not to reproduce the more complex situations seen in a real biological sample. One of the scenarios we could wish to simulate is a sample from a complex tissue containing multiple mature cell types. This situation can be modelled as two or more groups of cells where several genes are differentially expressed between the different groups. The previously published simulations can reproduce this situation to some degree but are often limited to fixed fold changes between only two groups. In the Splat simulation, however, complex cell mixtures can be simulated by modelling differential expression using a process similar to that for creating expression outliers. A proportion of genes are randomly selected to be up or down-regulated with given probabilities and then a multiplicative factor is chosen for these genes from a log-normal distribution and applied to the means. Setting the number of groups, the number of cells in each group and the proportion of differential expression allows flexibility in how different groups are defined. The resulting SCESet object contains information about which group each cell comes from as well as the factors applied to each gene in each group.
