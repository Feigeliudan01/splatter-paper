In "Overcoming confounding plate effects in differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data" \cite{Lun_2016} the same authors extend the negative-binomial model to include batch effects between groups of cells. The estimation step for this simulation is quite sophisticated and many of the parameters are sampled from a real dataset rather than statistical distributions. Differential expression between two groups is included and the user can optionally select to use a zero-inflated model.
