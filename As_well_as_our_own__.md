As well as our own Splat simulation Splatter provides implementations of several previously published simulations. These simulations have previously been published with R code or functions in existing packages but by including them in Splatter we make them available in a single place in a more user accessible way. Where only a script has been published (Lun, Lun 2) the simulation has been reimplemented in Splatter, if the simulation is in an existing R package (scDD) we have simply written wrappers that provide consistent input and output but use the package implementation. We have chosen to keep the simulations and estimation procedures as close as possible to what was originally published while keeping a consistent interface.
