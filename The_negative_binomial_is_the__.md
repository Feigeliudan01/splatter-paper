The negative-binomial is the most common distribution used to model RNA-seq data and the Simple simulation is a basic implementation of this approach. A mean expression level for each gene is simulated using a gamma distribution and the negative-binomial distribution is used to generate a count for each cell based on these means, with a fixed dispersion parameter (default = 0.1) (Supplementary Figure 1). This simulation is primarily included as a reference and is not meant to truly reproduce many of the features of scRNA-seq data.
