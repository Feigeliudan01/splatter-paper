The negative-binomial is the most common distribution used to model RNA-seq data, for example in the edgeR \cite{Robinson_2009} and DESeq \cite{Anders_2010} packages, and the Simple simulation is a basic implementation of this approach. A mean expression level for each gene is simulated using a gamma distribution and the negative-binomial distribution is used to generate a count for each cell based on these means, with a fixed dispersion parameter (default = 0.1) (Supplementary Figure 1). This simulation is primarily included as a baseline reference and is not meant to truly reproduce many of the features of scRNA-seq data.
