The Tung dataset (orange) is the real data on which the simulations were based. Looking across the metrics in Figure 1 it is clear the no single simulation consistently performs better than all the other. We see that the Splat and Simple simulations are skewed towards lowly expressed genes while the Lun 2 simulation which samples means from the original data best matches the real dataset (Figure 1A). However, Figure 1B shows that the Lun 2 simulation has some extremely variable genes. Figure 1C shows the relationship between mean and variance. The Simple and Splat simulations are good matches to the real data while the two Lun simulations are too variable relative to the mean. The scDD simulation shows an unusual pattern which does not match the trend seen in the Tung data. Figure 1D shows boxplots of library size. The two simulations (Splat and Lun 2) which explicitly include this in their model are good matches to the real data. The Simple simulation is similar to the real data but does not display any variability. The Lun simulation has too few counts per cell and the scDD simulation too many. The remaining two panels show the percentage of zeros in each gene (E) or cell (F). All of the simulations show too many zeros in both cases, with the exception of the scDD simulation which has too few. These plots demonstrate that no one simulation best matches the real dataset across all measures.
