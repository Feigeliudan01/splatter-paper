Published in "Pooling across cells to normalize single-cell RNA sequencing data with many zero counts" \cite{L_Lun_2016} the Lun simulation builds on the Simple simulation by adding a scaling factor for each cell (Supplementary Figure 2). The cell factors are randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 0.5. The inverse-\(\textrm{log}_2\) transformed factors are used to adjust the gene means resulting in a matrix, where each cell has a different mean. This represents the kinds of technical effects that normalisation aims to remove. The matrix of means are then used to sample counts from a negative binomial distribution, with a fixed dispersion parameter. This simulation can also model differential expression between multiple groups with fixed fold changes.
