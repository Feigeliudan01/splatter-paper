Published in "Pooling across cells to normalize single-cell RNA sequencing data with many zero counts" \cite{L_Lun_2016} the Lun simulation builds on the Simple simulation by adding a scaling factor for each cell (Supplementary Figure 2). The cell factors are randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 0.5. The inverse-(\(log_2)) transformed factors are used to adjust the gene means giving a different mean for each cell and are designed to represent the kinds of technical effects that normalisation aims to remove.  This simulation can also model differential expression between multiple groups with fixed fold changes.
