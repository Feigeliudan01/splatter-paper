_Abstracts are structured with a standard layout such that the text is divided into sub-sections under the following five headings: Motivation, Results, Availability and Implementation, Contact and Supplementary Information. In cases where authors feel the headings inappropriate, some flexibility is allowed. The abstracts should be succinct and contain only material relevant to the headings. A maximum of 150 words is recommended. If internet hyperlinks are available for any part of the abstract, then this should be given in the form of 'clickable text', i.e.{{http://www...}}._

**Motivation**
_This section should specifically state the scientific question within the context of the field of study._

**Results**
_This section should summarize the scientific advance or novel results of the study, and its impact on computational biology._

**Availability and Implementation**
_This section should state software availability if the paper focuses mainly on software development or on the implementation of an algorithm. Examples are: 'Freely available on the web at http://www.exampleurl.org.' Website implemented in Perl, MySQL and Apache, with all major browsers supported'; or 'Source code and binaries freely available for download at URL, implemented in C++ and supported on linux and MS Windows'. The complete address (URL) should be given. If the manuscript describes new software tools or the implementation of novel algorithms the software must be freely available to non-commercial users. Authors must also ensure that the software is available for a full TWO YEARS following publication. The editors of Bioinformatics encourage authors to make their source code available and, if possible, to provide access through an open source license (see www.opensource.org for examples._

**Contact**
_Full email address to be given, preferably an institution email address._

**Supplementary information**
_Links to additional figures/data available on a web site, pr reference to online-only supplementary data available at the journal's web site._
