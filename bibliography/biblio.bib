  author = {Lin, Peijie and Troup, Michael and Ho, Joshua W K},
  abstract = {Most existing dimensionality reduction and clustering packages for single cell RNA-Seq (scRNASeq) data deal with dropouts by heavy modelling and computational machinery. Here we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm which uses a novel yet very simple ``implicit imputation'' approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-Seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we have shown that CIDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA and RaceID, by at least 50\% in terms of clustering accuracy, and typically completes within seconds for processing a dataset of hundreds of cells.},
