Here we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm which uses a novel yet very simple ``implicit imputation'' approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-Seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we have shown that CIDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA and RaceID, by at least 50\% in terms of clustering accuracy, and typically completes within seconds for processing a dataset of hundreds of cells.},

  abstract = {The ability to quantify cellular heterogeneity is a major advantage of single-cell technologies. However, statistical methods often treat cellular heterogeneity as a nuisance. We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. We demonstrate that this framework can detect differential expression patterns under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, this method has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and can characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach.},

@article{Lun_2017,
  title = {{Overcoming confounding plate effects in differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data}},
  author = {Lun, Aaron T L and Marioni, John C},
  abstract = {An increasing number of studies are using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the gene expression profiles of individual cells. One common analysis applied to scRNA-seq data involves detecting differentially expressed (DE) genes between cells in different biological groups. However, many experiments are designed such that the cells to be compared are processed in separate plates or chips, meaning that the groupings are confounded with systematic plate effects. This confounding aspect is frequently ignored in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data. In this article, we demonstrate that failing to consider plate effects in the statistical model results in loss of type I error control. A solution is proposed whereby counts are summed from all cells in each plate and the count sums for all plates are used in the DE analysis. This restores type I error control in the presence of plate effects without compromising detection power in simulated data. Summation is also robust to varying numbers and library sizes of cells on each plate. Similar results are observed in DE analyses of real data where the use of count sums instead of single-cell counts improves specificity and the ranking of relevant genes. This suggests that summation can assist in maintaining statistical rigour in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data with plate effects.},

  author = {Wickham, Hadley},
  abstract = {1. 1 Welcome to ggplot2 ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is composed of a set of independent components that can be composed in many di?erent ways. This makesggplot2 very powerful, because you are not limited to a set of pre-speci?ed graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem. This may sound overwhelming, but because there is a simple set of core principles and very few special cases ggplot2 is also easy to learn (although it may take a little time to forget your preconceptions from other graphics tools). Practically,ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that take care of ?ddly details like drawing legends. The plots can be built up iteratively and edited later. A carefully chosen set of defaults means that most of the time you can produce a publication-quality graphic in seconds, but if you do have special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph that best reveals the messages in your data.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) differs from bulk RNASeq in that a large number of genes have zero reads in some cells, but relatively high expression in the remaining cells. We propose that these zeros, or dropouts, are due to failure of the reverse transcription, and we model the process using the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation. We show that the MM equation provides an equivalent or superior fit to existing scRNASeq datasets compared to other models. In addition, identifying genes significantly to the right of the MM curve is a fast and accurate method to distinguish differentially expressed genes without prior identification of subpopulations of cells. We applied our method to a mouse preimplantation dataset and demonstrate that clustering the selected genes identifies biologically meaningful clusters. Furthermore, this feature selection makes it possible to overcome batch effects and cluster cells from five different datasets by their biological groups rather than by experimental origin.},
