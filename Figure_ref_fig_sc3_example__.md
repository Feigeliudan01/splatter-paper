Figure \ref{fig:sc3-example} shows the results. Five measures were used to evaluate the clustering: the Rand index (Rand), Hubert and Arabie's (HA) adjusted Rand index and Morey and Agresti's (MA) adjusted Rand index (both of which adjust for chance groupings), Fowlkes and Mallows index (FM) and the Jaccard index (Jaccard). All of these indices attempt measure the similarity between two clusterings, in this case the clustering returned by SC3 and the true groups in the simulation. SC3 appears to identify clusters well in the majority of simulations, in some cases producing near perfect clustering. It may be interesting to examine individual cases further in order to identify when SC3 perform better. We can also look at the genes identified by SC3. For both DE genes and marker genes we see a similar pattern. On average approximately 3000 DE genes and 2600 markers genes passed SC3's automatic filtering and 84.5 DE genes were detected along with 83 marker genes (median values). Precision (the proportion identified genes that are true positives) is very high while recall (the proportion of true positives that were identified or true positive rate) is very low. This tells us that in this scenario SC3 is producing many false negatives but that the genes that it finds to be markers or DE are correct.
