Looking across the datasets we see that the Splat simulations are consistently good performers. On the Zeisel dataset both the zero-inflated simulations (Splat with dropout and Lun 2 ZINB) outperform their regular counterparts suggesting that this datasets is truly zero-inflated. Interestingly the Simple simulation is the best performer on the Engel dataset and best captures the variance and mean-variance relationship in the Tung dataset. This result suggests that the additional features of the more complex simulation may be unnecessary in this case or that other models may be more appropriate. The Lun simulation is consistently amongst the worst performing but, given that this model is largely similar to the others, it is likely due to the lack of an estimation procedure for most parameters than significant problems with the model. Most significantly we see that simulations perform differently on different datasets, emphasising the importance of trying different models and demonstrating their similarity to real datasets. The Splatter framework makes these comparisons between simulation models straightforward.
