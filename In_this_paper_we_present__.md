In this paper we present Splatter, a Bioconductor R package for simple simulation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Splatter is a framework designed to provide a consistent interface to multiple simulations, enabling researchers to quickly simulate scRNA-seq count data in a reproducible fashion and make comparisons between simulations and real data. Along with the framework we explain our own simulation model, Splat, and show how it compares to previously published simulations based on real datasets. We also provide a short example of how simulations can be used for assessing analysis methods.
