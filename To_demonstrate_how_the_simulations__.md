To demonstrate how the simulations available in Splatter could be used to evaluate a method we present an example evaluation of the clustering method SC3. SC3 is a consensus based approach available via Bioconductor. As well as assigning cells to groups SC3 is able to detect genes that are differentially expressed between one group and other cells and marker genes which are able to distinguish between groups. To test SC3 we started with parameters estimated from the Tung datasets and simulated three cell populations, each of which had 100 cells, with a differential expression probability of 0.01 resulting in approximately 130 DE genes in each group. We then ran SC3 with three clusters and compared the results to the true groupings. We also assessed the detection of DE and marker genes taking the true DE genes as any gene with a DE factor different from one in any group and true marker genes as genes where the DE factor did not equal one in a single group. This procedure was repeated 20 times with different random seeds to get some idea of variability and robustness of the method.
