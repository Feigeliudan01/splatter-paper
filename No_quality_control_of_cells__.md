No quality control of cells or filtering of genes was performed prior to estimation. We believe this presents the most challenging situation to simulate, as there are more likely to be violations of the underlying model, but also the most useful as it allows any analysis method to be evaluated, from low-level filtering to complex downstream analysis. In order to reduce the computational time 200 cells were randomly sampled from each dataset and used for estimation and each simulation consisted of 200 cells. Figure \ref{fig:comparison} shows the output of Splatter's comparison functions for simulations based on the Tung dataset.
