Simulated datasets are a useful tool for evaluating or comparing analysis however researchers need to be careful in how they are used. No simulation will ever fully reproduce a true biological dataset and even in the brief comparison shown above it is clear that different simulations behave in different ways. Researchers should attempt to understand the biases of the simulations they use and, where possible, borrow information from real datasets. Once we see how individual simulations differ from real data we can begin to identify weaknesses and address them. One approach may be to evaluate methods on multiple simulation models that have different known biases. Splatter is an R package that provides a consistent interface to multiple methods for simulating scRNA-seq data, making it easy to reuse, reproduce, adjust and compare simulation models. As part of Splatter we provide our own simulation method called Splat. This model is based on a gamma-poisson distribution and includes library size, a mean-variance trend and dropout. Splat can simulate complex populations of mature cells as well as differentiation paths between cell types. We hope that Splatter is useful in it's own right but also that it provides a guide for how to produce a reproducible simulation.
