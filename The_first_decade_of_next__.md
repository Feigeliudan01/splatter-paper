The first decade of next-generation sequencing has seen an explosion in our understanding of the genome \cite{Goodwin_2016}.
In particular, the development of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled unprecedented insight into the
dynamics of gene expression \cite{Ozsolak_2010}. Researchers now routinely conduct experiments designed
to test how gene expression is affected by various stimuli. One limitation of the "bulk" RNA-seq
experiments that have become commonplace over the last few years is that for each gene an average measure of expression is obtained
across the many cells in a sample. Recent technological developments allow the
extraction and amplification of minute quantities of RNA meaning that sequencing can now be conducted on
the level of single cells \cite{Tang_2009}. The increased resolution of this single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data makes
a range of new analyses possible.
