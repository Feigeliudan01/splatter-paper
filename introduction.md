# Introduction

* scRNA-seq is a rapidly developing area
* Difference focus
* Various challenges
* Many new methods being developed
* Need to be able to show:
  * Do what they say
  * Produce insight
* Use simulations to test the first one
* Current simulations are hard to understand/reproduce
* Present Splatter
  * Framework for scRNA-seq simulation
* Also our simulation method
