The scDD package aims to test for differential expression between two groups but also more complex changes such as differential distributions or differential proportions \cite{Korthauer_2015}. This is reflected in their simulation which can contain a mixture of genes simulated to have different distributions, or differing proportions where the expression of the gene is multi-modal. This simulation samples information from a real dataset. The splatter package simply provides wrapper functions to the simulation functions in the scDD R package, while capturing the necessary input and output needed to compare to other simulations. The scDD simulation is described in detail in the scDD vignette.
