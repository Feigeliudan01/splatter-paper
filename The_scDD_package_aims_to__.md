The scDD package aims to test for differential expression between two groups but also more complex changes such as differential distributions or differential proportions \cite{Korthauer_2015}. This is reflected in their simulation which can contain a mixture of genes simulated to have different distributions, or differing proportions where the expression of the gene is multi-modal. This simulation also samples information from a real dataset. The Splatter package simply provides wrapper functions to the simulation functions in the scDD package, while capturing the necessary input and output needed to compare to other simulations. The full details of the scDD simulation are described in the scDD package vignette.
