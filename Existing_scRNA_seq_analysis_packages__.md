Existing scRNA-seq analysis packages, and any new methods that are developed, should be able to demonstrate two things: 1) they can do what they claim to do, whether that is clustering, lineage tracing, differential expression testing or improved performance compared to other methods and 2) that they produce some meaningful biological insight. The answer to the second question is specific to particular experiments but it should be possible to answer to the first question in a more general way. The most common way to test the performance of an analysis method is through a simulation. Simulated data provides a known truth to test against making it possible to see when a method is right or wrong and opening access to a range of metrics for assessing performance. This is difficult with true biological data where an experiment must be specifically designed or results from an orthogonal test taken as the truth. An additional advantage of assessing performance on simulated data is that many datasets with different parameters and assumptions can be rapidly generated at minimal cost. Many of the packages that are currently available use simulations to demonstrate their effectiveness, however often this is not done in a reproducible or reusable way. Simulations are often not described in much details and the code to construct them may not be available. When code is available it is often poorly documented or written in a way that is specific to the computing environment of the authors.
