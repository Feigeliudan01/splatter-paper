\label{fig:zeros}Comparison of zeros in simulations based on the Tung dataset. The top row shows zeros per cell and the middle row zeros per gene. The left column shows boxplots in each simulation, the middle panel shows boxplots of the ranked difference from the real data and the right column shows a quantile-quantile plot. The bottom row shows scatter plots of the relationship between the mean expression of a gene and the percentage of zeros as both the raw observations and as ranked differences from the real data.
