\label{fig:ranks}Comparison of simulation models based on various datasets. For each dataset parameters were estimated and synthetic datasets generated using various simulation methods. The Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) between each simulation and the real data was calculated for a range of metrics and the simulations ranked. A heatmap of the ranks across the metrics and datasets is presented here, with text showing the MADs. We see that the Splat simulations (with and without dropout) performs consistently well, with the two versions of the Lun 2 simulation also being good performers.
