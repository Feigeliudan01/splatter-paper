\label{fig:complex}Examples of complex Splat simulations. On the left is a PCA plot of a simulation with multiple groups with varying numbers of cells and levels of differential expression. On the right is a PCA plot of a simulation with differentiation paths. A progenitor cell type (circles) differentiates into an intermediate cell type which becomes one of two (triangle or diamond) mature cell types. The coloured gradient indicates how far along a path each cell is from blue to pink.
