Comparison of different simulation methods as returned by Splatter's comparison function. The Tung dataset (orange) is the real data which parameters for the simulations were estimated from. Panel A shows the distribution of mean expression as a violin plot with the lower quartile, median and upper quartile marked as lines. Panel B shows a similar plot of gene variances. Panel C shows the relationship between mean and variance. In panel D we see a boxplot of library size. The next two panels show boxplots of the percentage of zeros in each gene (E) or cell (F), with the final panel (G) showing the relationship between mean expression and the percentage of zeros in each gene.
