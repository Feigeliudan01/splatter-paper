\label{fig:comparison}Comparison of simulations based on the Tung dataset. The left-most panels show the distribution of each statistic across the real dataset and the simulations. The middle panels show the distribution of the ranked differences for each statistic and the right-most panels show a quantile-quantile plot where the real dataset is taken as the theoretical distribution and the simulations as empirical distributions. The relationships between the mean expression of the each and both the variance of each gene and the percentage of zeros in each gene are also shown as both the raw relationship and the difference from the real dataset.
