Figure 1 shows the output of the comparison function included in Splatter. For each simulation we have estimated parameters from a real dataset then used them to produce a synthetic dataset of the same size. The real data we have used is a subset of data published by Tung et al. and contains 221 cells with 13058 genes from a single HapMap stem cell line, captured on three Fluidigm C1 plates \cite{Tung_2016}. Bad quality cells and lowly expressed genes have already been removed by the original authors but we also remove the ERCC spike-ins as these do not represent real genes. As we expect this to be a homogeneous population we do not simulate any differential expression but batch effects are included in the Lun 2 simulation. Figure \ref{fig:sim-comp} shows the plots returned by the comparison function.
